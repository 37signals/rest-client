= REST Client -- simple DSL for accessing REST resources

A simple REST client for Ruby, inspired by the Sinatra's microframework style
of specifying actions: get, put, post, delete.

== Usage: Raw URL

  require 'rest_client'

  RestClient.get 'http://example.com/resource'
  RestClient.get 'https://user:password@example.com/private/resource'

  RestClient.post 'http://example.com/resource', :param1 => 'one', :nested => { :param2 => 'two' }

  RestClient.delete 'http://example.com/resource'

See RestClient module docs for details.

== Usage: ActiveResource-Style

  resource = RestClient::Resource.new 'http://example.com/resource'
  resource.get

  private_resource = RestClient::Resource.new 'https://example.com/private/resource', 'user', 'pass'
  private_resource.put File.read('pic.jpg'), :content_type => 'image/jpg'

See RestClient::Resource module docs for details.

== Usage: Resource Nesting

  site = RestClient::Resource.new('http://example.com')
  site['posts/1/comments'].post 'Good article.', :content_type => 'text/plain'

See RestClient::Resource docs for details.

== Shell

The restclient shell command gives an IRB session with RestClient already loaded:

  $ restclient
  >> RestClient.get 'http://example.com'

Specify a URL argument for get/post/put/delete on that resource:

  $ restclient http://example.com
  >> put '/resource', 'data'

Add a user and password for authenticated resources:

  $ restclient https://example.com user pass
  >> delete '/private/resource'

Create ~/.restclient for named sessions:

  sinatra:
    url: http://localhost:4567
  rack:
    url: http://localhost:9292
  private_site:
    url: http://example.com
    username: user
    password: pass

Then invoke:

  $ restclient private_site
  
== Logging

Choose a log within your program:

  RestClient.log = '/tmp/restclient.log'

Or set an environment variable to avoid modifying the code:

  $ RESTCLIENT_LOG=stdout path/to/my/program

Either one produces logs like this:

  RestClient.get 'http://some/resource'
  # => 200 OK | text/html 250 bytes
  RestClient.put 'http://some/resource'
  # => 401 Unauthorized | application/xml 340 bytes

Note that these logs are valid Ruby, so you can paste them into the restclient
shell to replay your sequence of calls.
