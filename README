= REST Client -- simple DSL for accessing REST resources

A simple REST client for Ruby, inspired by the microframework (Camping,
Sinatra...) style of specifying actions: get, put, post, delete.

== Usage

  require 'rest_client'

  xml = RestClient.get 'http://some/resource'
  jpg = RestClient.get 'http://some/resource', :accept => 'image/jpg'

  RestClient.put 'http://some/resource', File.read('my.pdf'), :content_type => 'application/pdf'

  RestClient.post 'http://some/resource', xml, :content_type => 'application/xml'

  RestClient.delete 'http://some/resource'

== Shell

Require rest_client from within irb to access RestClient interactively, like
using curl at the command line.  Better yet, require gem from within your
~/.rush/env.rb and have instant access to it from within your rush (http://rush.heroku.com) sessions.
